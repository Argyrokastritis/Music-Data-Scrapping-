<h1>Creation of Music </h1><p>"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song an   music piece a work with both singing and instruments or another type of music. In many cultures including Western classical music the act of composing also includes the creation of   such as a   "score" which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music the act of composing which is typically called songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song called the   which sets out the     and  . In classical music the composer typically   his or her own compositions but in musical theatre and in pop music songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases a songwriter may not use notation at all and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. 
 Even when music is notated relatively precisely as in classical music there are many decisions that a performer has to make because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or   of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as   whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.

Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration   listening and cooperation while also promoting understanding of   improving the ability to   information and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.  In elementary schools children often learn to play instruments such as the   sing in small choirs and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools children sing   and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools) students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles such as   (a group of singers)     jazz bands or orchestras. In some school systems music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private   after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g. learning about   for   and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.
 At the university level students in most arts and   programs can receive   for taking a few music courses which typically take the form of an overview course on the   or a   course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in such as choirs marching bands concert bands or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe such as the   in     or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea Japan and China. At the same time Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures such as the   or Bali (e.g.   music).

Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the   and there is disagreement surrounding whether music developed before after or simultaneously with language.  A similar source of contention surrounds whether music was the intentional result of   or was a byproduct   of evolution.  The earliest influential theory was proposed by   in 1871 who stated that music arose as a form of   perhaps via mating calls.  Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other sexual selection methods  though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted the theory.  Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor improving long-distance communication benefiting communication with the   assisting in community cohesion or as a defense to scare off predators. 
  can only be theorized based on findings from   archaeology sites. The   carved from a     is thought to be at least 40000 years old though there is considerable debate surrounding whether it is truly a   or an object formed by animals.  The earliest objects whose designations as musical instruments are widely accepted are   from the   Germany namely from the     and   caves.  Dated to the   (of the Upper Paleolithic) and used by   from all three caves there are eight examples four made from the   of birds and four from  ; three of these are near complete.  Three flutes from the Geissenklösterle are dated as the oldest   BP.

 Reading music as if it were in a different clef from the one indicated can be an aid in   since it will move the pitches roughly in parallel to the written part. Key signatures and accidentals need to be accounted for when this is done.
