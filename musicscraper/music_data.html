        <h1>Creation</h1><p>"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an ,  music piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of , , such as a ,  "score", which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the , , which sets out the , , ,  and , . In classical music, the composer typically ,  his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead, compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music., 
, Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or ,  of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as , , whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.,

,  can only be theorized based on findings from ,  archaeology sites. The , , carved from a ,  , , is thought to be at least 40,000 years old, though there is considerable debate surrounding whether it is truly a ,  or an object formed by animals.,  The earliest objects whose designations as musical instruments are widely accepted are ,  from the , , Germany, namely from the , , ,  and ,  caves.,  Dated to the ,  (of the Upper Paleolithic) and used by , , from all three caves there are eight examples, four made from the ,  of birds and four from , ; three of these are near complete.,  Three flutes from the Geissenklösterle are dated as the oldest, ,  BP.,

Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form, and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, the UK, and the US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre, and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed upon. Below is a list of the three official versions of the "elements of music":
, In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: "appropriate , " was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the "elements of music" to the "inter-related dimensions of music". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure, and appropriate musical notations.,

,  of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as ,  (fMRI), ,  (TMS), ,  (MEG), ,  (EEG), and ,  (PET).
