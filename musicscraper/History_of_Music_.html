<h1>History of Music </h1>The original source of the paragraph can be found here: <button onclick="window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music', '_blank');">Original Source</button><p>It is often debated to what extent the origins of music will ever be understoodand there are competing theories that aim to explain it.Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and theorigin of language and there is disagreement surrounding whether music developed before after or simultaneously with language.A similar source of contention surrounds whether music was the intentional result ofnatural selectionor was a byproductspandrelof evolution.The earliest influential theory was proposed byCharles Darwinin 1871 who stated that music arose as a form ofsexual selection perhaps via mating calls.Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other sexual selection methodsthough many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted the theory.Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor improving long-distance communication benefiting communication with thedivine assisting in community cohesion or as a defense to scare off predators. Prehistoric musiccan only be theorized based on findings frompaleolithicarchaeology sites. The disputedDivje Babe flute a perforatedcave bearfemur is at least 40000 years old though there is considerable debate surrounding whether it is truly amusical instrumentor an object formed by animals.The earliest objects whose designations as musical instruments are widely accepted arebone flutesfrom theSwabian Jura Germany namely from theGeissenklösterleHohle FelsandVogelherdcaves.Dated to theAurignacian(of the Upper Paleolithic) and used byEarly European modern humans from all three caves there are eight examples four made from thewing bonesof birds and four frommammoth ivory; three of these are near complete.Three flutes from the Geissenklösterle are dated as the oldestc.43150–39370BP.[n 3] The earliest material and representational evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to thePredynastic period but the evidence is more securely attested in theOld Kingdomwhenharpsflutesanddouble clarinetswere played.Percussion instrumentslyres andluteswere added to orchestras by theMiddle Kingdom.Cymbalsfrequently accompanied music and dance much as they still do inEgypttoday. Egyptianfolk music including the traditionalSufidhikrrituals are the closest contemporarymusic genretoancient Egyptianmusic having preserved many of its features rhythms and instruments. The "Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal" found onclay tabletsin the ancientSyriancity ofUgarit is the oldest surviving notated work of music dating back to approximately 1400 BCE. Music was an important part of social and cultural life inancient Greece in fact it was one of the main subjects taught to children. Musical education was considered important for the development of an individual's soul. Musicians and singers played a prominent role inGreek theaterand those who received a musical education were seen as nobles and in perfect harmony (as can be read in theRepublic Plato). Mixed genderchorusesperformed for entertainment celebration and spiritual ceremonies.Instruments included the double-reedaulosand a pluckedstring instrument thelyre principally a special kind called akithara. Music was an important part of education and boys were taught music starting at age six. Greek musical literacy created significant musical development. Greekmusic theoryincluded the Greekmusical modes that eventually became the basis for Westernreligiousandclassicalmusic. Later influences from theRoman Empire Eastern Europe and theByzantine Empirechanged Greek music. TheSeikilos epitaphis the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition including musical notation from anywhere in the world.The oldest surviving work written about music theory isHarmonika StoicheiabyAristoxenus. Asian music covers a swath of music cultures surveyed in the articles onArabiaCentral AsiaEast AsiaSouth Asia andSoutheast Asia. Several have traditions reaching into antiquity. Indian classical musicis one of the oldest musical traditions in the world.Sculptures from theIndus Valley civilizationshow danceand old musical instruments like the seven-holed flute. Stringed instruments and drums have been recovered fromHarappaandMohenjo Daroby excavations carried out byMortimer Wheeler.TheRigveda an ancient Hindu text has elements of present Indian music with musical notation to denote the meter and mode of chanting.Indian classical music (marga) ismonophonic and based on a single melody line orragarhythmically organized throughtalas. The poemCilappatikaramprovides information about how new scales can be formed by modal shifting of the tonic from an existing scale.Present dayHindi musicwas influenced byPersian traditional musicandAfghanMughals.Carnatic music popular in the southern states is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are songs emphasizing love and other social issues. Indonesian musichas been formed since theBronze Ageculture migrated to theIndonesian archipelagoin the 2nd-3rd centuries BCE. Indonesian traditional music uses percussion instruments especiallykendangandgongs. Some of them developed elaborate and distinctive instruments such as thesasandostringed instrument on the island of Rote theSundaneseangklung and the complex and sophisticatedJavaneseandBalinesegamelanorchestras. Indonesia is the home ofgong chime a general term for a set of small high pitched pot gongs. Gongs are usually placed in order of note with the boss up on a string held in a low wooden frame. The most popular form of Indonesian music is gamelan an ensemble of tunedpercussion instrumentsthat includemetallophonesdrumsgongsandspike fiddlesalong withbamboosuling(like aflute). Chinese classical music the traditional art or court music of China has a history stretching over about 3000 years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation as well as musical tuning and pitch musical instruments and styles or genres. Chinese music ispentatonic-diatonic having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5 + 7 = 12) as does European-influenced music. Themedieval musicera (500 to 1400) which took place during theMiddle Ages started with the introduction ofmonophonic(single melodic line)chantingintoCatholic Churchservices.Musical notationwas used since ancient times inGreek culture but in the Middle Ages notation was first introduced by the Catholic Church so chant melodies could be written down to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the monophonicliturgicalplainsongchant of the Catholic Church the central tradition of which was calledGregorian chant. Alongside these traditions ofsacredandchurch musicthere existed a vibrant tradition ofsecular song(non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period areLéoninPérotinGuillaume de Machaut andWalther von der Vogelweide. Renaissance music(c.1400to 1600) was more focused on secular themes such ascourtly love. Around 1450 theprinting presswas invented which made printedsheet musicmuch less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the press all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music spread musical styles quicker and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era includeGuillaume Du FayGiovanni Pierluigi da PalestrinaThomas MorleyOrlando di LassoandJosquin des Prez. As musical activity shifted from the church to aristocratic courts kings queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading composers came from the Netherlands Belgium and France; they are called the Franco-Flemish composers.They held important positions throughout Europe especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany England and Spain. The Baroque era of music took place from 1600 to 1750 coinciding with the flourishing of theBaroqueartistic style in Europe. The start of the Baroque era was marked by the penning of the firstoperas.Polyphoniccontrapuntalmusic (music with separate simultaneousmelodic lines) remained important during this period. German Baroque composers wrote for smallensemblesincludingstringsbrass andwoodwinds as well as forchoirsand keyboard instruments such aspipe organharpsichord andclavichord. Musical complexity increased during this time. Several major musical forms were created some of them which persisted into later periods seeing further development. These include thefugue theinvention thesonata and theconcerto.The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era includeJohann Sebastian Bach(Cello suites)George Frideric Handel(Messiah)Georg Philipp TelemannandAntonio Vivaldi(The Four Seasons). The music of the Classical period (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from theClassical periodshould not be confused with Classical music in general a term which refers to Westernart musicfrom the 5th century to the 2000s which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods). Music from the Classical period has a lighter clearer and considerably simpler texture than theBaroque musicwhich preceded it. The main style washomophonywhere a prominentmelodyand a subordinate chordalaccompanimentpart are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed and thefortepiano the forerunner to the modern piano replaced the Baroque eraharpsichordandpipe organas the main keyboard instrument (though pipe organ continued to be used in sacred music such as Masses). Importance was given toinstrumentalmusic. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: thesonata the concerto and thesymphony. Other main kinds were thetriostring quartetserenadeanddivertimento. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era from string quartets to symphonies and concertos were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments usedchamber musicand orchestra became more standardized. In place of thebasso continuogroup of the Baroque era which consisted of harpsichord organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g. viol cello theorbo serpent) Classical chamber groups used specified standardized instruments (e.g. astring quartetwould be performed by two violins a viola and a cello). The practice of improvised chord-playing by the continuo keyboardist or lute player a hallmark of Baroque music underwent a gradual decline between 1750 and 1800. One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera andoratorio became more popular. The best known composers of Classicism areCarl Philipp Emanuel BachChristoph Willibald GluckJohann Christian BachJoseph HaydnWolfgang Amadeus MozartLudwig van BeethovenandFranz Schubert. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era as it began to move towards Romanticism. Romantic music (c.1820to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with theRomanticstyles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic literary and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such asWagnerandBrahmsattempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonictone poems composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promotednationalisticpride with patriotic orchestral music inspired byfolk music. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition. Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy and went further in thesyncretismof exploring different art-forms in a musical context (such as literature) history (historical figures and legends) or nature itself.Romantic loveor longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g. thesonata formused instring quartetsandsymphonies) but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases new approaches were explored for existing genres forms and functions. Also new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music exploring new styles and themes. In the years after 1800 the music developed byLudwig van BeethovenandFranz Schubertintroduced a more dramatic expressive style. In Beethoven's case shortmotifs developed organically came to replacemelodyas the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in hisFifth Symphony). Later Romantic composers such asPyotr Ilyich TchaikovskyAntonín Dvořák andGustav Mahlerused more unusualchordsand moredissonanceto create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period composers explored dramaticchromaticalterations oftonality such asextended chordsandaltered chords which created new sound "colors." The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and theIndustrial Revolutionhelped to create better instruments creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-dourbansociety. It also saw a new diversity intheatre music includingoperetta andmusical comedyand other forms of musical theatre. In the 19th century a key way new compositions became known to the public was by the sales ofsheet music which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments such as the violin. With20th-century music the invention of newelectric technologiessuch asradio broadcastingandmass marketavailability ofgramophone recordsmeantsound recordingsheard by listeners (on the radio or record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces.There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity andphonographswere used to replay and distribute music; anyone with a radio or record player could hear operassymphoniesandbig bandsin their own living room. During the 19th century the focus on sheet music had restricted access to new music to middle and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and other instruments. Radios and record players allowed lower-income people who could not afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. As well people could hear music from different parts of the country or even different parts of the world even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles. The focus ofart musicin the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms styles and sounds. The horrors of World War I influenced many of the arts including music and composers began exploring darker harsher sounds.Traditional musicstyles such asjazzandfolk musicwere used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music.Igor StravinskyArnold Schoenberg andJohn Cagewere influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of sound recording and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenres of classical music including theacousmaticandMusique concrèteschools of electronic composition. Sound recording was a major influence on the development of popular music genres because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of themultitrack recordingsystem had a major influence onrock music because it could do more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. Jazz evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century and during the second half rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence ofAfricanand European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use ofblue notesimprovisationpolyrhythmssyncopation and theswung note. Rock music is a genre ofpopular musicthat developed in the 1950s fromrock and rollrockabillyblues andcountry music.The sound of rock often revolves around the electric or acoustic guitar and it uses a strongback beatlaid down by arhythm section. Along with the guitar or keyboards saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form" it "has three chords a strong insistent back beat and a catchy melody."The traditional rhythm section for popular music is rhythm guitar electric bass guitar drums. Some bands have keyboard instruments such as organ piano or since the 1970sanalog synthesizers. In the 1980s pop musicians began using digital synthesizers such as theDX-7synthesizer electronicdrum machinessuch as theTR-808and synth bass devices (such as theTB-303) orsynth basskeyboards. In the 1990s an increasingly large range of computerized hardware musical devices and instruments and software (e.g.digital audio workstations) were used. In the 2020ssoft synthsand computer music apps make it possible forbedroom producersto create and record types of music such aselectronic dance music in their home adding sampled and digital instruments and editing the recording digitally. In the 1990s bands in genres such asnu metalbegan includingDJsin their bands. DJs create music by manipulating recorded music using aDJ mixer.</p></body></html>
