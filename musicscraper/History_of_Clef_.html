<h1>History of Clef </h1>The original source of the paragraph can be found here: <button onclick="window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clef', '_blank');">Original Source</button><p>Before the advent of clefs the reference line of a staff was simply labeled with the name of the note it was intended to bear:FC or sometimesG. These were the most common 'clefs' orlitterae clavis(key-letters) in Gregorian chant notation. Over time the shapes of these letters became stylised leading to their current versions. Many other clefs were used particularly in the early period of chant notation keyed to many different notes from the lowΓ(gamma the G on the bottom line of the bass clef) to the G above middle C (written with a small letterg). These included two different lowercasebsymbols for the note just below middle C: round for B♭ and square for B♮. In order of frequency of use these clefs were:FcfCDageΓB and the round and squareb.In later medieval music the roundbwas often written in addition to another clef letter to indicate that B♭rather than B♮was to be used throughout a piece; this is the origin of thekey signature. In thepolyphonic periodup to 1600 unusual clefs were occasionally used for parts with extremely high or low tessituras. For very low bass parts the Γ clef is found on the middle fourth or fifth lines of the staff (e.g. inPierre de La Rue'sRequiemand in a mid-16th-century dance book published by the Hessen brothers); for very high parts the high-D clef (d) and the even higherffclef (e.g. in theMulliner Book) were used to represent the notes written on the fourth and top lines of the treble clef respectively. The practice of using different shapes for the same clef persisted until very recent times. The F-clef was until as late as the 1980s in some cases (such as hymnals) or in British and French publications written like this: In printed music from the 16th and 17th centuries the C clef often assumed a ladder-like form in which the two horizontal rungs surround the staff line indicated as C:; this form survived in some printed editions (see this example written infour-part men's harmonyand positioned to make it equivalent to an octave G clef) into the 20th century. The C-clef was formerly written in a more angular way sometimes still used or more often as a simplifiedK-shape when writing the clef by hand: In modern Gregorian chant notation the C clef is written (on a four-line staff) in the formand the F clef as The flourish at the top of the G-clef probably derives from a cursiveSfor "sol" the name for "G" insolfege. C clefs (along with G F Γ D and A clefs) were formerly used to notate vocal music. Nominally the soprano voice parts were written in first- or second-line C clef (soprano cleformezzo-soprano clef) or second-line G clef (treble clef) the alto or tenor voices in third-line C clef (alto clef) the tenor voice in fourth-line C clef (tenor clef) and the bass voice in third- fourth- or fifth-line F clef (baritonebass orsub-bass clef). Until the 19th century the most common arrangement for vocal music used the following clefs: In more modern publications four-part music on parallel staffs is usually written more simply as: This may be reduced to two staffs the soprano and alto sharing a staff with a treble clef and the tenor and bass sharing a staff marked with the bass clef.</p></body></html>
