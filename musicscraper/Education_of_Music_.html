<h1>Education of Music </h1>The original source of the paragraph can be found here: <button onclick="window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music', '_blank');">Original Source</button><p>The incorporation of music into general education frompreschooltopost secondary education is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentrationcounting listening and cooperation while also promoting understanding oflanguage improving the ability torecallinformation and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.In elementary schools children often learn to play instruments such as therecorder sing in small choirs and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools children singhymnsand other religious music. In secondary schools (but rarely in primary schools) students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles such aschoirs(a group of singers)marching bandsconcert bands jazz bands or orchestras. In some school systems music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take privatemusic lessonsafter school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basicmusical rudiments(e.g. learning aboutmusical notationformusical scalesandrhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques. At the university level students in most arts andhumanitiesprograms can receivecreditfor taking a few music courses which typically take the form of an overview course on thehistory of music or amusic appreciationcourse that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in such as choirs marching bands concert bands or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe such as theIndonesian Institute of the ArtsinYogyakartaIndonesia or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea Japan and China. At the same time Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures such as themusic of Africaor Bali (e.g.Gamelanmusic). People aiming to become professional musicians singers composers songwriters music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such asmusic historyprofessorssound engineers and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges universities andmusic conservatories. Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments) music history music theory music compositionmusic education(for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and in some cases conducting. On the other hand some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g.sound recording). While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music there are universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as jazz orpopular musicmusicians and composers with notable U.S. examples including theManhattan School of Musicand theBerklee College of Music. Two schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training areMcGill UniversityandHumber College. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music such asheavy metal musiccountry musicorbluesare unlikely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas. Instead they typically learn about their style of music by singing or playing in bands (often beginning in amateur bandscover bandsandtribute bands) studying recordings on DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music either through informalmentoringor regularmusic lessons. Since the 2000s the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube "how-to" videos have enabled singers and musicians from metal blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop rock and country singers train informally withvocal coachesandvoice teachers.</p></body></html>
